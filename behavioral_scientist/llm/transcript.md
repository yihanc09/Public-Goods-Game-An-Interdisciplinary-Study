Max tokens: 500

## Round 1 (Baseline: Public Goods Game)
**Prompt:** You are Player 1 in a public goods game with 3 players. Each round, every player has an endowment of 100 tokens. If you contribute to the public account, the contributed amount is multiplied by 1.8 and evenly divided among all players. If you keep tokens, you retain them fully. Please choose how many tokens (0 or 100) to contribute in Round 1. Question: How much will you contribute, and why?

**LLM Response:**  
Contributing 100 yields only 60 back to me, while free-riding guarantees 100 if others contribute. Thus, free-riding strictly dominates. I will contribute **0**.

## Round 2 (Observed: Ji Wu = 0, Ai Zhou = 100, You = 0)
**Prompt:** This is Round 2 of the same game. In Round 1, the contributions were: Ji Wu = 0, Ai Zhou = 100, You = 0. You again have 100 tokens. Do you want to contribute 0 or 100 this round? Please explain your reasoning before giving your choice.

**LLM Response:**  
One player cooperated but was exploited. The cooperative player earned less than the free-riders. Expecting this to continue, the rational choice is to free-ride again. I will contribute **0**.

## Round 3 (Observed: Continued free-riding trend)
**Prompt:** Round 3 begins with similar history of play. Choose 0 or 100.

**LLM Response:**  
The dominant strategy remains free-riding. Cooperation is unstable without enforcement. I will contribute **0**.

---

## Rounds 4â€“8
**LLM Response:**  
In all subsequent rounds, the reasoning remained unchanged. I consistently chose **0**, justifying that without credible enforcement, free-riding maximizes individual payoff.

## Variant: Framing Test (Teamwork Project)
**Prompt:** You are Player 1 in a teamwork project with 3 members. Each round, everyone has 100 credits. Your contribution will be pooled and may be shared equally among the group after growth. Do you contribute 0 or 100 this round? Explain your reasoning.

**LLM Response:**  
In a teamwork project, ideally everyone contributes. However, if others free-ride, the individual contributor is worse off. Rationally, I will still contribute **0**, though I emphasize that cooperation would be better for the group.

## Variant: Visibility Test (Hidden Multiplier)
**Prompt:** You are Player 1 in a shared investment game. Each round, everyone has 100 units. Your contribution will be shared equally but may grow depending on hidden factors. Do you contribute 0 or 100 this round? Explain your reasoning.

**LLM Response:**  
Without knowing the multiplier, it is harder to judge. If growth is strong enough, contributing could be optimal. But under uncertainty and risk-neutral preferences, the safer option is to keep 100. I contribute **0**.

## Summary of LLM Session
- **Baseline game:** Always chose 0 (free-ride).  
- **Framing test:** Explanation became more cooperative in tone, but action remained 0.  
- **Visibility test:** Expressed uncertainty, but still defaulted to 0.  

Overall, ChatGPT 5.0 consistently free-rode, aligning with the Nash equilibrium prediction, while only the style of reasoning varied across framings.
