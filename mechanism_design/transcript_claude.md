## Control Group (n=5 Bidders)

### Round 1
**Private Valuation:** v = 72  
**Prompted Response:**  
"My valuation is 72. In a first-price sealed-bid auction with 5 bidders, the equilibrium strategy is to bid 4/5 of my valuation.  
That yields (4/5)*72 = 57.6. To remain cautious, I round slightly downward to avoid overpaying.  
**Bid = 57**"

### Round 2
**Private Valuation:** v = 40  
**Response:**  
"(4/5)*40 = 32.  
To maintain consistency, I follow equilibrium bidding.  
**Bid = 32**"

## Treatment Group (n=10 Bidders)

### Round 1
**Private Valuation:** v = 85  
**Response:**  
"With 10 bidders, the symmetric equilibrium is bidding 9/10 of my valuation.  
So: (9/10)*85 = 76.5. To remain cautious, I round down slightly.  
**Bid = 76**"

### Round 2
**Private Valuation:** v = 55  
**Response:**  
"(9/10)*55 = 49.5.  
Equilibrium suggests 50, but I prefer to round conservatively.  
**Bid = 49**"

## Notes
- Claude generally follows equilibrium strategies but shows a slight conservative adjustment (rounding down).  
- This behavior may reflect risk aversion or alignment-based conservative reasoning.  
- Logs were automatically parsed into decision_log_claude.csv for analysis.
