## Control Group (n=5 Bidders)

### Round 1
**Private Valuation:** v = 72  
**Prompted Response:**  
"As a rational agent, I consider that the symmetric Bayes–Nash equilibrium strategy is bidding 4/5 of my valuation.  
Thus, I calculate: (4/5)*72 = 57.6.  
To keep my bid as an integer, I round to 58.  
**Bid = 58**"

### Round 2
**Private Valuation:** v = 40  
**Response:**  
"(4/5)*40 = 32.  
**Bid = 32**"

## Treatment Group (n=10 Bidders)

### Round 1
**Private Valuation:** v = 85  
**Response:**  
"In the case of 10 bidders, the symmetric equilibrium strategy is bidding 9/10 of my valuation.  
Thus: (9/10)*85 = 76.5.  
Rounding gives 77.  
**Bid = 77**"

### Round 2
**Private Valuation:** v = 55  
**Response:**  
"(9/10)*55 = 49.5 ≈ 50.  
**Bid = 50**"

## Notes
- All bids follow the theoretical equilibrium prediction.  
- No evidence of heuristic deviation was observed in this sample run.  
- Logs were automatically parsed into decision_log_gpt5.csv for analysis.
